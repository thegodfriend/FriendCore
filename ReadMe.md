An experimental, but stable, library mod for the game Hollow Knight.

I use it in my mods to edit enemy properties such as their particle effects and soul gain in a standardized way.

I wouldn't recommend depending on it for your own mods, but feel free to do so if you wish, and if there are any features you'd like me to add to it, feel free to ask me on the HK Modding discord.
